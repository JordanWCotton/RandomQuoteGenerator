# RandomQuoteGenerator
Randomly generates quotes that can be shared via tweets



Project that involves use of Jquery, JSON, and AJAX in addition to responsive web design principles.

Includes button that allows user to tweet the currently displayed quote directly to their twitter accounts using the Twitter API.

I utilized Bootstrap, jQuery, FontAwesome, the Twitter API and Forismatic API.
