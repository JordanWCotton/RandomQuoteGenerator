# RandomQuoteGenerator
This is a simple application that randomly generates quotes that can then be shared via Tweets.

I built this project utilizing Bootstrap, jQuery, FontAwesome, Andruxnet's quote database API, and Twitter's tweet widget. This project was a simple example of using jQuery to make an AJAX request to an API, and utilizing the JSON data that was provided in response. 

This application is hosted on Heroku, and is available at https://jwc-randquotegen.herokuapp.com/index.html.
