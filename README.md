# RandomQuoteGenerator
This is a simple application that randomly generates quotes that can then be shared via Tweets.

I built this project utilizing Bootstrap, jQuery, FontAwesome, the Forismatic quote database API, and Twitter's tweet widget. This project was a simple example of using jQuery to make an AJAX request to an API, and utilizing the JSON data that was provided in response.
